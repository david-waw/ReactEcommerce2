      question: 'What exactly is a cryptocurrency?',
      answer: 'A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency designed to work as a medium of exchange.It uses cryptography to secure and verify transactions as well as to control the creation of new units of a particular cryptocurrency. Essentially, cryptocurrencies are limited entries in a database that no one can change unless specific conditions are fulfilled.With this approach cryptocurrencies do not rely on central banks or trusted third parties to verify transactions.Cryptocurrencies are decentralized and run by a network of computers instead of a single person or a company.The money you own is stored in a digital wallet you keep in the cloud or offline on a PC and can be sent to someone via a computer or a mobile device like a smartphone.Each transaction is recorded in what is called a blockchain that is publicly available to all currency holders.To learn more about cryptocurrencies and how they work, please have a look for example at.blockgeeks.com '
