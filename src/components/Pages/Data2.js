        question: 'Our Vendor Selection and Requirements',
        answer: 'Our site was born as a result of Hansa Market take down on July 4th by the Dutch Police in a joint operation with help of the German police and the Feds.We had sold over 1,700+ orders on Hansa Market and lost a lot of money when it went down.Our fellow vendors on Hansa Market we feel your pain; because you are already experienced with vending we would love to see you partnering with us to serve our client base.However, due to a lot of scams going around we have high requirements to our vendors to be able to keep up the high quality that we offer our clients.If accepted, you will be paid on “post payment” basis meaning you will deliver the service to us or our client first and then get paid after, if you have a problem with that please DO NOT contact us, there are NO EXCEPTIONS to this.We expect a top level of both product and service quality from our vendors.Only vendors who know their product and have a professional appearance will be accepted as vendors. Please understand that your customers are the key to your and also our success.That is why we will offer them the best experience they can have on the our platform. We will take the following information into account for deciding about your application.Please understand that there are no “hard” requirements like a certain rating on other markets. The overall appearance is what matters.Post Payment.Product portfolio.Product descriptions and images.Total orders on Empire or other markets (at least several hundreds).Ratings on other markets.Feedback on forums.Professionalism in messages.If you agree to our above requirements and willing to make $$$ then we would love to hear from you.',
