<p><strong><span >&nbsp;We only offer our services on this platform&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You may find it strange for a site like ours to have terms and <span ><a  href="/privacypolicy/">Privacy Policy</a></span>, which is the reason we have them, we are strange creatures!</span></p>
<p><span>This site was born after the <strong>“Operation Bayonet”</strong> took down Hansa market that we were trading on.</span></p>
<p><span >We created this <span ><a href="/ShopPage/">shop</a> </span>to serve our loyal customer base who stayed true to us even after the murder of “Hansa Market” by the Dutch Police in operation bayonet.</span></p>
<p><span>We always welcome new customers but we stay focused on our old ones, they pay us $ to help them make $$$, this is a business, nothing personal.</span></p>
<p><span >Although we do have a <strong>“10% Crypto cashback incentive”</strong>, not all customers are bothered to take advantage of it, although we understand this is just an incentive and <strong>NOT</strong> a requirement.</span></p>
<p><span>Please do not contact us looking for something that you do not see on the site it’s plain stupid, if we have it we will put it on the site. </span></p>
<p><span>However, if you provide us with a <strong>“vouch/feedback”</strong> within the next 7 days after the delivery of goods/services you will be entitled to a 10% crypto cashback <span >(the 7 days start from the time you get the item/service)</span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Generally, all terms are described under the heading on their ads as well as in the description itself. However, we do use our common sense each and every second of the day.</span></p>
<p><span >We also have an <strong>ICQ</strong> and <strong>Telegram </strong>Group chat reserved for our customers and you are very welcome to join them if you like, you will find the links to our groups in your order details email.</span></p>
<p><span>We have laid out some ground rules to protect our services.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>We will <strong>NOT</strong> be responsible after you receive funds in your Paypal, Venmo, Cashapp accounts if it gets limited for being new or unverified.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span >We will <strong>NOT</strong> be responsible for Paypal, Venmo, Cashapp funds under review for the same reason explained above.</span></li>
<li><span>In general, we will <strong>NOT</strong> be responsible for any account limitations on the client-side in the case where the account is provided by the client, it is your responsibility to know the limits of your account.</span></li>
<li>
<div><span >We will <strong>RESEND FUND</strong> that was chargeback/reversed <strong>ONLY</strong> within the <strong>first 96 hours of you receiving funds/transfers</strong>, 4 days is plenty of time for you to move or withdraw funds, after the 4 days we will <strong>NOT</strong> be responsible if the funds are reversed due to a chargeback.</span></div>
